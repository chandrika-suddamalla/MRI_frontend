# Market Research Intelligence Assistant

> An AI-powered web application that helps Product, Strategy, and Go-To-Market (GTM) teams gather, analyse, and validate market intelligence from multiple public sources using Large Language Models (LLMs).

---

## Project Overview

Market intelligence is often scattered across blogs, company announcements, news articles, and product pages. Manually collecting and analysing this information is time-consuming and difficult to validate.

The **Market Research Intelligence Assistant (MRI)** automates this process by allowing users to:

- Research competitors and market topics
- Analyse multiple public URLs
- Generate structured AI-powered summaries
- Trace every insight back to its original source
- Verify generated insights using an **LLM-as-a-Judge** approach
- Store previously generated reports for future reference

# Future Improvements

The current implementation focuses on delivering the core assignment requirements while maintaining a modular architecture. The following enhancements could further improve the application:

- **Change Detection:** Automatically compare newly generated reports with previous analyses to highlight new competitor announcements, product launches, pricing changes, or market trends since the last run.

- **Report Comparison:** Allow users to compare multiple reports side by side to identify evolving market trends, competitor strategies, and changes over time.

- **Scheduled Research Jobs:** Enable users to schedule recurring market research (daily, weekly, or monthly), automatically generating updated reports without manual intervention.

- **Email Notifications:** Notify users via email whenever a scheduled report is completed or significant competitor activity is detected.

- **Semantic Search with Vector Database:** Store report embeddings in a vector database to enable semantic search, allowing users to retrieve relevant historical reports using natural language queries.

- **Support for Multiple LLM Providers:** Extend the architecture to support additional AI models such as OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude, or Azure OpenAI, giving users flexibility in model selection.

- **Streaming AI Responses:** Stream report generation in real time so users can view insights as they are generated, improving the overall user experience for longer analyses.

- **Multi-language Support:** Enable analysis of sources in multiple languages and generate summaries in the user's preferred language, making the application suitable for global market research.
